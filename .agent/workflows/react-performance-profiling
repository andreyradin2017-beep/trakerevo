description: Profile React application performance (Bundle Size, Code Splitting, Render Performance)
---

1. **Analyze Bundle Size**:
   - Run `npm run build` to see the size of generated chunks.
   - Check for any chunks larger than 500kB.

2. **Verify Code Splitting**:
   - Check `src/App.tsx` to ensure all major routes are lazy-loaded using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.
   - Verify that `vite.config.ts` has `manualChunks` configured to split vendor libraries (React, UI, Data).

3. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - Check `package.json` for heavy dependencies.
   - Verify `lucide-react` and other UI libraries are tree-shakable (imported correctly).

4. **Runtime Performance**:
   - (Manual) User should run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools.
   - (Manual) User should check for unnecessary re-renders using React DevTools Profiler.

5. **Image Optimization**:
   - Verify that images use `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` (except LCP).
   - Check if image proxying/resizing is enabled (wsrv.nl or similar).
